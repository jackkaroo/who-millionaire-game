# Tesk Task Genesis (Headway) ðŸ‘¾

Hello!  This is "Who wants to be a millionaire?" game! \
In file config.json you can customize the game configurations: \
enter several correct answers, change or add questions and answers to them. \
You can also add a few questions to one level of reward, then the user will \
receive question of curtain level randomly. \
Most questions are about books so I hope you will enjoy testing:)


I had some problem with deploying app to Github Pages and configuring HashRouter for it,\
so I decided to return back BrowserRouter in my master branch. \
So to test my work please run the app locally.

But you can still see my work on the Github Pages, \
but because of HashRouter it doesn't work properly.\
